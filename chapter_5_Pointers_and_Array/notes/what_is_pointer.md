<h1><u>Pointers</u></h1>



A pointer is a variable that contains the 
address of a variable. Pointers are much used in C,
partly sometimes they are the only way to express
a computation, partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient 
code then the alternative methods. 

<b><u>It is easy to create pointers, that would point to unexpected
places in the memory that would cause a segmentation fault during runtime at best and 
bugs during production at worst.</u></b>
